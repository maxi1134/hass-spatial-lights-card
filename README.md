Made because controlling dozens of lightbulbs became otherwise impossible: it required infinite scrolling to find the right light or group.

This card allows arbitrary positioning and instant selection and control of dozens of lights on a 2D canvas.

# Spatial Lights Card for Home Assistant

The Spatial Lights Card lets you place many Home Assistant lights on a 2D canvas, for example, corresponding to their physical locations, making it easy to control arbitrary groups of entities with very few taps and little attention.

You can drag to draw a rectangle around lights, which you'll immediately be able to control as a group. You can toggle individual lights

Very useful when you have a lot of lights, and searching for the one you need by name and icon is tiresome; you can position the lights in a layout that corresponds to the physical room layout, making it easy to select the light you need. You can add a background image, e.g., with the room layout.

## 🎨 Usage

### Selecting Lights

| Action | Desktop | Mobile |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Select a single light | Click | Tap |
| Add/remove from selection | Shift+Click, Ctrl+Click, or Cmd+Click | — |
| Select area (marquee) | Click and drag on empty canvas | Drag on empty canvas (a near-vertical drag scrolls instead — start at an angle, or hold ~0.3 s first) |
| Add area to selection | Shift/Ctrl/Cmd + drag on empty canvas | — |
| Select all lights | Ctrl+A / Cmd+A | — |
| Deselect all | Click/tap empty canvas, or press Escape | Tap empty canvas |

When lights are selected, the color wheel, brightness slider, and temperature slider control all selected lights as a group. If you have a **default entity** configured, the controls affect that entity when nothing is selected.

> **Note:** On touch devices the card shares the canvas with page scrolling: a drag on empty canvas that starts **near-vertically** (within ~22° of straight up/down) scrolls the dashboard, while any other drag draws the selection box — and once the box has started, it can travel in any direction without being interrupted. For a deliberately vertical box, hold your finger still for a moment first (a short vibration confirms it), then drag. Pinch-zoom always works. Set `canvas_touch_scroll: false` to reserve every canvas touch for selection instead.

### Toggling Lights On/Off

| Action | Desktop | Mobile |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Toggle a light | Double-click | Double-tap |
| Toggle a switch/scene | Double-click (or single click if `switch_single_tap` is on) | Double-tap (or single tap if `switch_single_tap` is on) |
| Turn the whole selection on/off | Power button under the sliders | Power button beside the color wheel |

> **Note:** If `switch_single_tap` is enabled, switches and scenes activate immediately on a single tap/click instead of being selected.

The **power button** sits at the start of the presets row — under the sliders on desktop, beside the color wheel on mobile — so the sliders keep their full width. It acts on whatever the sliders control: the selected lights, or the default entity when nothing is selected. It is filled when every one of them is on (pressing turns them all off), outlined when only some are on (pressing turns the rest on), and neutral when all are off. Hide it with `show_power_button: false`.

### Opening Light Details

| Action | Desktop | Mobile |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Open more-info panel | Long-click (~650 ms) or right-click | Long-press (~500 ms) |

The more-info panel is the standard Home Assistant entity dialog where you can see attributes, history, and settings.

### Color Wheel

- **Tap/click** on the mini color wheel to immediately apply that color to selected lights.
- **Long-press** the mini color wheel (400 ms on touch, 600 ms on mouse) to open a **full-screen color picker** with a magnifier for precise color selection.
  - Drag around the large wheel to preview colors in the magnifier.
  - Lift your finger / release the mouse to apply the color.
  - Close with the **Done** button, by clicking the backdrop, or by pressing **Escape**.

### Brightness & Temperature Sliders

- **Drag** horizontally along a slider to adjust the value smoothly.
- **Tap/click** anywhere on the slider track to jump to that value.
- The brightness slider ranges from 0–255 (displayed as a percentage).
- The temperature slider range depends on the light's capabilities (in Kelvin).
- On mobile, if you start scrolling vertically while touching a slider, the slider releases so you can scroll the page.

### Color Presets & Live Colors

- **Click/tap** a preset circle to apply that color to all selected lights.
- **Hover** over a preset (desktop) to temporarily highlight which lights on the canvas currently have that color.
- **Long-press** a preset (~300 ms, mobile) to highlight which lights have that color. Release to clear the highlight.
- When all selected lights share the same color as a preset, that preset shows a subtle active ring indicator.
- **Live colors** (when `show_live_colors` is enabled) show the colors currently in use by your lights, automatically deduplicated.
- **Live temperatures** appear as a separate group. A thin vertical separator line divides color presets from temperature presets when they are on the same row.

### Moving Lights on the Canvas

Lights are **locked** by default. To reposition them:

1. Open the card editor (pencil icon on the dashboard).
2. Toggle **Edit Positions** in the card settings.
3. Drag lights to their new positions on the preview — changes flow into the editor automatically; press **Save** to persist them.

| Action | Desktop | Mobile |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Move a light | Drag | Drag |
| Snap to grid | Hold **Alt** while dragging | — |
| Nudge selected lights | Arrow keys (moves 0.5% per press) | — |
| Fine nudge | Alt + Arrow keys (moves 1% per press) | — |
| Undo move | Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z | — |
| Redo move | Ctrl+Y / Cmd+Shift+Z | — |

Position history stores up to 50 steps.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+A / Cmd+A | Select all lights |
| Escape | Deselect all / close color wheel / close dialogs |
| Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z | Undo position change |
| Ctrl+Y / Cmd+Shift+Z | Redo position change |
| Arrow keys | Nudge selected lights (when positions unlocked) |
| Alt + Arrow keys | Fine-nudge selected lights |

### Desktop vs Mobile Differences

- **Layout:** On screens wider than 768 px, controls use a two-column grid (color wheel + sliders side by side). On mobile (768 px or narrower), controls stack vertically.
- **Preset highlighting:** On desktop, hovering over a preset highlights matching lights. On mobile, you need to long-press (~300 ms) the preset.
- **Light size:** On mobile, light circles are capped at 50 px regardless of the configured `light_size`.
- **Floating controls:** On desktop, floating controls are centered. On mobile, they stretch edge-to-edge with padding.
- **Multi-select modifiers** (Shift/Ctrl/Cmd) are only available on desktop.

### 💡 Tips

1. Click/tap empty space on the canvas to deselect all lights.
2. Add a **Default Entity** containing all of a room's lights to control the whole room when nothing is selected.
3. Add **color presets** to quickly apply favorite colors with a single tap.
4. Enable **live colors** to see and reuse colors already present in the room.
5. Hover over a preset (or long-press on mobile) to see which lights currently have that color.
6. Use **Ctrl+A** to quickly select all lights for batch adjustments.
7. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) any light to open its full detail panel.

## 📋 All Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `title` | string | `""` | Card title. When empty, the header is hidden entirely. |
| `entities` | list | **required** | Entities (lights, switches, input_booleans, scenes) to display. |
| `positions` | map | `{}` | Per-entity x/y positions from 0–100 (percentage). |
| `canvas_height` | number | `450` | Canvas height in pixels. Used when no background image supplies a ratio (and as the fallback while the image loads). Ignored when `aspect_ratio` is set or auto-aspect is active. |
| `aspect_ratio` | string | `null` | Optional `"W:H"` (e.g. `"16:9"`, `"1200x800"`). The canvas derives its height from its width so positions stay glued to a floor-plan background at any card width. Usually unnecessary — a background image supplies its own ratio. |
| `light_field` | map/bool | `{enabled: false}` | Shared-canvas light diffusion: colours merge additively and walls cast real shadows. See [Light Diffusion](#light-diffusion-light_field). |
| `grid_size` | number | `25` | Grid spacing in pixels when snapping. |
| `label_mode` | string | `"smart"` | Light label style: `smart` (compact abbreviation), `full` (alias `friendly_name`), `initials`, `entity_id`, `none`. |
| `canvas_touch_scroll` | boolean | `true` | Vertical touch swipes on the canvas scroll the page (marquee needs a sideways drag). Set `false` to reserve all canvas touches for selection. |
| `theme_mode` | string | `"auto"` | `auto` follows your HA theme (including glass themes), `dark` keeps the card's original dark palette, `light` is a fixed light palette. |
| `theme` | map | `{}` | Fine-grained appearance overrides — see [Theming](#-theming). |
| `label_overrides` | map | `{}` | Map entity_id → custom label. |
| `color_overrides` | map | `{}` | Map entity_id → color string OR object (`state_on`, `state_off`). |
| `switch_on_color` | string | `"#ffa500"` | Default color for active switches. |
| `switch_off_color` | string | `"#3a3a3a"` | Default color for inactive switches. |
| `scene_color` | string | `"#6366f1"` | Default color for scenes. |
| `always_show_controls` | boolean | `false` | Always show color controls even when nothing selected. Use if you prefer persistent sliders that are always there even if nothing is selected and there's no default_entity. |
| `show_power_button` | boolean | `true` | Round on/off button at the start of the presets row (under the sliders on desktop, beside the color wheel on mobile) that toggles the selected lights (or the default entity) as a group. Filled = all on (press turns off); outlined = some on (press turns the rest on). |
| `minimal_ui` | boolean | `false` | Hides light circles; shows only icons. Automatically enables `icon_only_mode`. |
| `controls_below` | boolean | `true` | Render controls below (`true`) or floating over (`false`). |
| `default_entity` | string | `null` | Entity to control when nothing is selected. |
| `switch_single_tap` | boolean | `false` | Toggle switches/scenes with a single tap instead of selecting them. |
| `show_entity_icons` | boolean | `true` | Show MDI icons inside the light circles. |
| `icon_style` | string | `"mdi"` | Icon style (`mdi` or `emoji`). |
| `light_size` | number | `56` | Size of light circles in pixels. On mobile (≤768 px viewport), the rendered size is capped at 50 px regardless of this value. |
| `icon_only_mode` | boolean | `false` | Display lights as icons only (no filled circles). |
| `icon_rotation` | number | `0` | Global icon rotation in degrees (0–360). |
| `icon_rotation_overrides` | map | `{}` | Per-entity icon rotation overrides (e.g., `light.lamp: 90`). |
| `icon_mirror` | string | `"none"` | Global icon mirroring: `none`, `horizontal`, `vertical`, or `both`. |
| `icon_mirror_overrides` | map | `{}` | Per-entity icon mirror overrides (e.g., `light.lamp: "horizontal"`). |
| `size_overrides` | map | `{}` | Per-entity size overrides (e.g., `light.lamp: 40`). |
| `icon_only_overrides` | map | `{}` | Per-entity icon-only mode overrides (e.g., `light.lamp: true`). |
| `background_image` | string/map | `null` | URL string or object `{url, size, position, repeat, blend_mode, opacity}`. `opacity` accepts 0–1. `repeat` accepts any CSS `background-repeat` value (e.g. `no-repeat`, `repeat`). |
| `color_presets` | list | `[]` | Hex color strings to show as quick-select circles (e.g., `["#ff0000", "#00ff00"]`). |
| `show_live_colors` | boolean | `false` | Show the current colors of your lights as additional preset circles. |
| `effect_presets` | list | `[]` | Named effect presets with icons and optional light restrictions (see [Effect Presets](#-effect-presets)). |

| `effect_filter_selected` | string | `"all"` | Effect visibility when lights are selected: `any` or `all`. |
| `adaptive_lighting` | boolean/map | `false` | Adaptive-lighting toggle button among the effect presets; needs the [Adaptive Lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting) integration. `true` enables it (switch auto-detected); a map with `enabled: true` pins the switch and tunes the call (see [Adaptive Lighting](#-adaptive-lighting)). |
| `binary_sensor_on_color` | string | `"#4caf50"` | Default color for binary sensors in the `on` state. |
| `binary_sensor_off_color` | string | `"#2a2a2a"` | Default color for binary sensors in the `off` state. |
| `temperature_min` | number | `null` | Override minimum Kelvin for temperature slider. |
| `temperature_max` | number | `null` | Override maximum Kelvin for temperature slider. |
| `temperature_range` | list/map | `null` | Alternate spelling for the two above. Accepts either `[min, max]` (e.g. `[2200, 6500]`) or `{min: 2200, max: 6500}`. If both forms are provided, the explicit `temperature_min`/`temperature_max` win. |
| `glow` | map | `{}` | Glow effect configuration (see [Glow Effects](#-glow-effects) section). |
| `glow_overrides` | map | `{}` | Per-entity glow overrides (e.g., `light.lamp: {direction: 180}`). |

## 🖌 Custom Colors & Backgrounds

### Global Colors
Customize the default appearance of non-light entities by setting the Switch On Color, Switch Off Color, and Scene Color.
<!--```yaml
switch_on_color: "#00ff00"
switch_off_color: "#ff0000"
scene_color: "#55aaff"
```-->


### Color Presets

Add quick-select color circles next to the color wheel so you can apply frequently used colors with a single tap.
<!--```yaml
color_presets:
  - "#ff0000"
  - "#00ff00"
  - "#0000ff"
  - "#ff8800"
  - "#e040fb"
```-->
<img height="171" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e045c141-7206-4d0d-a8ad-af676cd2b2aa" />

<br/><br/>

Enable **Show Live Colors** to also display the current colors of your lights as preset circles. When hovering a preset (or long-pressing on mobile), the lights that currently have that color are highlighted on the canvas. If all controlled lights share the same color, the matching preset shows a subtle ring indicator.

<!--```yaml
color_presets:
  - "#ff0000"
  - "#00ff00"
show_live_colors: true
```-->

### Individual Overrides

Have a switch or some other entity that you want to have a specific color when it's on/off?

<img width="41" height="40" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19080d4d-49a9-4f0a-9ead-47c25f61027b" />

Use Color Overrides. You can provide a single color (applied when "on") or specific colors for both states. (Above is the override with #02fae9 for state_on.)

<!--```yaml
color_overrides:
  # Simple string = On color
  scene.movie_night: "#a855f7"
  switch.kitchen_fan: "#00ff00"

  # Object = Specific state colors
  switch.hallway:
    state_on: "#ffffff"
    state_off: "#444444"
```-->

### Background Image
Add a floorplan or texture behind your lights.
```yaml
background_image:
  url: "/local/floorplan.png"
```

That is the whole configuration for a floor plan. The canvas measures the image
and adopts its aspect ratio, so the plan fills the canvas **exactly** — never
cropped, never letterboxed, never squashed — and a light placed over the sofa on
desktop stays over the sofa on a phone.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `url` | — | Image URL (`/local/...`, `/api/image/serve/...`, or absolute) |
| `auto_aspect` | `true` | Canvas takes the image's intrinsic aspect ratio (overridden only by `aspect_ratio`) |
| `fit` | `contain` | `contain`, `cover` (crops), `stretch` (distorts), `native` |
| `rendering` | `auto` | CSS `image-rendering` — use `pixelated` for hand-drawn or low-resolution plans |
| `size` | — | Raw CSS `background-size`; overrides `fit` when set |
| `position` / `repeat` / `blend_mode` / `opacity` | CSS defaults | Passed straight through |

Auto-aspect steps aside as soon as you pin the geometry yourself — set
`aspect_ratio`, or `auto_aspect: false`:

```yaml
# Pin the geometry yourself instead
background_image:
  url: "/local/floorplan.png"
  auto_aspect: false
canvas_height: 520
```

`canvas_height` does **not** override auto-aspect; it is the fallback for when
there is no plan image, or the image fails to load. (Cards added through the UI
used to always carry a `canvas_height`, which would have meant the fix never
engaged for them.)

> **Upgrading:** if you previously matched `aspect_ratio` to your image by hand,
> nothing changes. If you did not, your canvas now takes the plan's ratio rather
> than a fixed height, so the whole plan becomes visible and your light
> positions land on the plan features their percentages always referred to —
> under the old `cover` default the plan was cropped, so they didn't. Set
> `auto_aspect: false` and `fit: cover` to keep the previous look exactly.

### Light Size
Customize the size of light circles globally or per-entity.

<!--```yaml
# Global size (default is 56px)
light_size: 40

# Per-entity sizes
size_overrides:
  light.ceiling: 70    # Make ceiling light larger
  light.accent: 30     # Make accent light smaller
```-->

### Icon-Only Mode

Display lights as icons without the filled circle background. Icons show the light's color when on and remain visible (dimmed) when off.

Also experiment with Minimal UI.

<!--```yaml
# Enable for all lights
icon_only_mode: true

# Or per-entity
icon_only_overrides:
  light.ceiling: true      # Icon-only for ceiling
  switch.fan: true         # Icon-only for fan switch
  light.floor_lamp: false  # Keep filled circle for floor lamp
```-->

When icon-only mode is enabled:
- Icons are colored based on the light's state
- A subtle border ring shows the light's color when on
- Off lights remain visible with a dimmed appearance
- Great for cleaner layouts or when using background images

---

## ✨ Effect Presets

Add quick-apply buttons for named light effects (e.g., colorloop, fireplace, candle). Each preset shows as a labeled icon button alongside color presets.

### Basic Usage

```yaml
effect_presets:
  - effect: colorloop
    icon: mdi:palette
  - effect: fireplace
    icon: mdi:fireplace
```

### Preset Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `effect` | string | **required** | The effect name (must match the light's `effect_list`). |
| `icon` | string | `"mdi:auto-fix"` | MDI icon displayed on the button. |
| `lights` | list | `[]` (all) | Restrict this effect to specific entities. When empty, the effect applies to all canvas entities that support it. |
| `filter_default` | string | `""` (use global) | Per-preset override for visibility when nothing is selected: `any`, `all`, or empty to use the global `effect_filter_default`. |
| `filter_selected` | string | `""` (use global) | Per-preset override for visibility when lights are selected: `any`, `all`, or empty to use the global `effect_filter_selected`. |

### Filtering Logic

Effect presets are only shown when relevant. Two global settings control visibility:

- **`effect_filter_default`** (default: `any`): When nothing is selected, show the effect if **any** canvas entity supports it.
- **`effect_filter_selected`** (default: `all`): When lights are selected, show the effect only if **all** selected lights support it.

Each preset can override the global mode with its own `filter_default` / `filter_selected`.

### Light Restrictions

Use `lights` to restrict which entities an effect applies to. This is useful when an effect is only available on certain lights:

```yaml
effect_presets:
  - effect: colorloop
    icon: mdi:palette
    lights:
      - light.led_strip_1
      - light.led_strip_2
    filter_default: any
  - effect: fireplace
    icon: mdi:fireplace
    lights:
      - light.table_lamp
    filter_default: all
    filter_selected: all
```

- **Visibility**: A preset with a `lights` restriction is only shown when at least one restricted light is in the current pool (all entities when nothing selected, or the selected lights).
- **Applying**: When clicked, the effect is applied to the intersection of the selected lights and the restriction. With no selection, it applies to all restricted lights.

### Active Indicator

When all controlled lights share the same active effect, the matching preset button shows a ring indicator — the same behavior as color presets.

Effect presets can be configured in the visual editor's **Effect Presets** section.

---

## 🌗 Adaptive Lighting

If you run the [Adaptive Lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting) custom integration (HACS), the card can show an extra effect-style **toggle button** that hands the selected lights to adaptive control — brightness and color temperature follow the sun — or pauses it again.

**Requires the integration**: the card itself doesn't compute sun-based brightness; it drives the integration's services. Enable the button with `adaptive_lighting: true` (or the switch in the visual editor's **Presets** section, which also tells you which Adaptive Lighting switches it found). The `switch.adaptive_lighting_*` main switch is auto-detected, so that one line is all you need when you have a single Adaptive Lighting configuration.

**What a press does** (to the selected lights, or all card lights when nothing is selected):

- **Not adapted → enable.** Calls `adaptive_lighting.set_manual_control` with `manual_control: false` for the pressed lights that the switch manages — Adaptive Lighting marks a light "manually controlled" and stops adapting it the moment you touch its brightness or color (e.g. with this card's sliders); this un-marks them so continuous adaptation resumes. Then calls `adaptive_lighting.apply` so the current adaptive brightness/color land immediately — including on lights the switch doesn't manage, which get a one-shot adaptation.
- **Adapted (button lit) → pause.** Calls `adaptive_lighting.set_manual_control` with `manual_control: true`, so the lights hold their current values and Adaptive Lighting leaves them alone — the same thing it does by itself when you adjust a light by hand. Press again to resume; turning a light off and on also hands it back to Adaptive Lighting.

**Lit state**: the button shows the ring indicator when every targeted light is currently under adaptive control (switch on, light managed, not marked manually controlled) — that is also when a press pauses instead of enables. Hovering (or long-pressing on touch) highlights the card lights being adapted right now.

### Configuration

```yaml
adaptive_lighting: true   # that's it for the common case
```

All options:

```yaml
adaptive_lighting:
  enabled: true              # required to show the button
  switch: switch.adaptive_lighting_living_room  # pin a switch; auto-detected when omitted
  name: Adaptive             # button label/tooltip
  icon: mdi:theme-light-dark # button icon
  turn_on_lights: false      # apply also turns on lights that are off
  transition: 2              # seconds, passed to adaptive_lighting.apply
  adapt_brightness: true     # let apply adjust brightness
  adapt_color: true          # let apply adjust color temperature
  prefer_rgb_color: false    # prefer RGB over color temp when applying
  clear_manual_control: true # false = enabling is a one-shot apply that doesn't un-pause the lights
```

**Multiple Adaptive Lighting configurations**: with several main switches and no `switch:` configured, the card picks the switch managing the most of the card's lights (read from the switch's `configuration` attribute). If none of them overlaps, the button is hidden — set `switch:` explicitly.

The visual editor exposes the essentials under **Presets → Adaptive Lighting button** (on/off, switch, turn-on-lights); the remaining options are YAML-only.

## 💡 Glow Effects

Add beautiful, customizable glow effects behind your light entities. Glows respond to entity state — they light up when the entity is on and dim when off. Glow works with lights, switches, binary sensors, and input booleans.

### Basic Usage

Enable glow in the visual editor's **Glow** section, or in YAML:

```yaml
glow:
  enabled: true
```

### Glow Shapes

| Shape | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cone` | Directional cone emanating from the entity (default). |
| `semicone` | Cone that starts with a configurable width instead of a point. Use `start_width` to control. |
| `round` | Circular radial glow centered on the entity. |
| `oval` | Elliptical glow, rotatable with `direction`. |
| `beam` | Narrow directional beam (minimal spread). |
| `spotlight` | Wide directional cone with inherent edge softness. |
| `bar` | Rectangular linear gradient. |
| `custom` | Arbitrary shape defined by polar coordinates (see [Custom Shapes](#custom-shapes)). |

| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable glow for all entities. |
| `shape` | string | `"cone"` | Glow shape (see table above). |
| `direction` | number | `0` | Direction in degrees. 0 = down, 90 = right, 180 = up, 270 = left. |
| `length` | number | `80` | Glow length/diameter in pixels. |

### Example Configurations

**Soft round glow:**
```yaml
glow:
  enabled: true
  shape: round
  intensity: 0.5
  blur: 20
  edge_softness: 0.8
  falloff: smooth
```

**Directional cone pointing right:**
```yaml
glow:
  enabled: true
  shape: cone
  direction: 90
  length: 120
  width: 80
  spread: 2.0
```

**Semicone (starts wide, expands further):**
```yaml
glow:
  enabled: true
  shape: semicone
  start_width: 0.4
  direction: 0
  length: 100
```

### Custom Shapes

Define arbitrary glow shapes using polar coordinates. Each point is `[angle_degrees, radius]` where:
- **Angle**: 0° = down, 90° = right, 180° = up, 270° = left (clockwise)
- **Radius**: 0 = center, 1 = full extent (can go up to 2)

Points are cosine-interpolated for smooth curves. Minimum 3 points required.

```yaml
glow:
  enabled: true
  shape: custom
  edge_softness: 0.6
  custom_shape:
    - [0, 1.0]     # Full extent downward
    - [90, 0.5]    # Half extent to the right
    - [180, 0.3]   # Short upward
    - [270, 0.5]   # Half extent to the left
```

### Falloff Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `smooth` | Smooth hermite curve (default). Natural-looking falloff. |
| `linear` | Linear gradient from full opacity to zero. |
| `exponential` | Rapid falloff near the edges, concentrated near the center. |
| `sharp` | Hard center with abrupt edge transition. |
| `uniform` | Solid color fill with no gradient (use `edge_softness` for soft edges). |

### Per-Entity Glow Overrides

Override glow settings per entity using `glow_overrides`. Any parameter from the glow config can be overridden:

```yaml
glow:
  enabled: true
  shape: cone
  direction: 0

glow_overrides:
  light.ceiling:
    shape: round
    intensity: 0.9
  light.wall_sconce:
    direction: 90      # Points right
    length: 150
  light.floor_lamp:
    enabled: false      # Disable glow for this entity
```

Per-entity glow overrides for shape, direction, and intensity can also be configured in the visual editor by expanding each entity's settings.

### Light Diffusion (`light_field`)

The glow shapes above are decorative: each one is its own DOM element, so where
two of them overlap the topmost simply wins and the colours never mix.

`light_field` replaces them with a single shared canvas layered over the plan.
Every light is painted onto that one surface additively, so **overlapping lights
merge like real light** — a red pool crossing a blue pool is genuinely magenta
and genuinely brighter — and `glow_walls` become true occluders that **cast
shadows**, computed as exact visibility polygons rather than approximated with a
bitmap mask.

```yaml
light_field: true      # shorthand for {enabled: true}
```

That single line is enough: every light diffuses its own colour across the plan,
and any walls you have configured block it.

```yaml
light_field:
  enabled: true
  over_plan: normal    # how the layer blends with the plan
  exposure: 1.0        # global brightness of the diffusion
  radius: 190          # px reach for lights with no glow config of their own
  samples: 5           # soft shadows: 1 = hard edges, 3/5/9 = penumbra
  source_radius: 8     # px emitter size, only used when samples > 1
  ambient: 0.15        # a wide, faint second wash
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch. Off = today's per-light glow elements, unchanged |
| `over_plan` | `normal` | `normal`, `screen`, `multiply`, `plus-lighter`, `overlay`, `soft-light`, `hard-light` |
| `blend` | `lighter` | How lights accumulate with *each other*: `lighter` (additive) or `screen` |
| `exposure` | `1.0` | 0–4 multiplier on the layer's alpha |
| `radius` | `190` | px reach for a light with no `glow` config |
| `falloff` | `smooth` | Same curves as `glow.falloff` |
| `samples` | `1` | `1`, `3`, `5`, `9` — area-light samples for soft shadows |
| `source_radius` | `6` | px emitter radius; only meaningful when `samples > 1` |
| `ambient` | `0` | 0–1 second, wider, low-intensity pass |
| `ambient_reach` | `2.5` | Reach multiplier for that pass |
| `quality` | `auto` | `auto`, `low`, `medium`, `high` — backing-store resolution |
| `max_pixels` | `2600000` | Backing-store budget in device pixels |
| `show_walls` | `auto` | `auto` (only while drawing), `always`, `never` |
| `wall_color` / `wall_width` | theme / `2` | Appearance of the drawn wall outline |

**Choosing `over_plan`.** `normal` reads correctly on any plan and is the
default. `screen` suits dark blueprints (it is a no-op over white). `multiply`
suits white plans and is the most physically literal — a white floor under a red
bulb really does look red — but it crushes a dark plan toward black.

**Existing `glow` config still applies.** When a light has `glow` enabled, the
field uses its shape, size, direction, colour and falloff, so cones, beams and
ovals all diffuse and cast shadows through the new renderer. Lights without any
glow config diffuse as a plain round pool of `radius`.

Two glow keys are deliberately ignored by the field: `blur` and
`edge_softness`. Both existed to fake soft edges on a hard-edged DOM element —
the field's shadow edges are real geometry, and softening them is what
`samples` / `source_radius` do (a penumbra that widens with distance from the
wall, as it should). Set `samples: 1` for crisp shadow edges.

Cost is modest: 12 lights against 30 wall segments with 5-sample soft shadows
measures ~6.5 ms for a full solve and ~1.1 ms once the visibility polygons are
cached (they are keyed on geometry only, so colour and brightness changes never
re-solve). The card falls back to the classic renderer if a 2D canvas is
unavailable.

### Glow Walls

Glow walls are invisible line segments or boxes that block glow from expanding in certain directions — like physical walls in a room. They use 2D ray-casting to create realistic shadow masks.

**Line segment** (x1, y1 → x2, y2 in canvas percentage coordinates):
```yaml
glow_walls:
  - [10, 50, 90, 50]       # Horizontal line across the middle
  - {x1: 50, y1: 10, x2: 50, y2: 90}  # Vertical line (object form)
```

**Box** (expands to 4 line segments):
```yaml
glow_walls:
  - {x: 20, y: 20, width: 60, height: 60}  # Rectangular wall
```

Coordinates use the same 0–100% coordinate system as entity positions. You can mix line segments and boxes:
```yaml
glow_walls:
  - [0, 50, 40, 50]                       # Left wall segment
  - [60, 50, 100, 50]                     # Right wall segment
  - {x: 30, y: 70, width: 40, height: 30} # Bottom room box
```

Glow walls can also be configured in the visual editor's **Glow Walls** section.

#### Drawing walls on the plan

Typing four numbers per wall is a poor way to lay out a floor plan, so the editor
can turn the preview into a drawing surface. Open the card editor, expand
**Glow Walls**, and switch on **Draw walls on the plan**:

| Gesture | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Drag on empty canvas | Draw a wall |
| Release, then press at the same corner | Continue the run from there — trace a room in one gesture |
| `Esc` | End the run (the next drag starts a fresh wall) |
| Drag an endpoint | Move that end |
| Drag a wall's body | Move the whole wall |
| Long-press a wall, or hover + `Delete` | Remove it |
| Hold `Alt` | Ignore snapping |
| `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Z` | Undo the last wall edit |

Snapping is **on** while drawing — endpoint-to-endpoint first, then 45° angles,
then the grid. That polarity is deliberately the opposite of dragging lights
(where `Alt` *enables* snap): an unclosed corner is invisible while you draw it
and obvious later, when light leaks through the gap.

Walls you draw are written back to `glow_walls` as ordinary line segments, so
they stay editable as YAML. A `box` you drag an edge of is expanded into its four
segments at that point, since its sides can then move independently.

## Canvas Elements

Place non-entity elements on the canvas alongside your lights. Useful for navigation links, sensor readouts, or custom labels.

Three element types are supported:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `link` | An icon button with configurable tap/hold/double-tap actions. |
| `sensor` | Displays an entity's state value (with optional prefix/suffix) and icon. |
| `template` | Displays static text content with an optional icon. |

### Element Properties

All element types share these properties:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | **required** | `link`, `sensor`, or `template`. |
| `position` | map | `{x: 50, y: 50}` | Position on canvas in percentage coordinates. |
| `label` | string | `null` | Text label displayed on the element. |
| `show_background` | boolean | `true` | Show a background behind the element. |
| `tap_action` | map | `null` | Action on tap (see below). |
| `hold_action` | map | `null` | Action on long-press. |
| `double_tap_action` | map | `null` | Action on double-tap. |
| `style` | map | `{}` | Styling: `color`, `font_size`, `font_weight`, `opacity`, `background`, `border_radius`, `letter_spacing`, `text_shadow`. |

**Link** elements also accept `icon` (default `"mdi:link"`) and `size` (default `40`).

**Sensor** elements also accept `entity` (required), `prefix`, `suffix` (default: entity's `unit_of_measurement`), `show_icon` (default `true`), and `icon` (default: entity's icon).

**Template** elements also accept `content` (static text) and `icon`.

### Actions

Actions follow the standard Home Assistant format:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `more-info` | Open the entity's more-info dialog. |
| `toggle` | Toggle the entity. |
| `navigate` | Navigate to a path (`navigation_path`). |
| `url` | Open a URL (`url_path`). |
| `call-service` | Call a service (`service`, `service_data`/`data`). |
| `none` | Do nothing. |

### Example

```yaml
canvas_elements:
  - type: sensor
    entity: sensor.living_room_temperature
    position: {x: 80, y: 10}
    suffix: "°C"
  - type: link
    icon: mdi:floor-plan
    label: "Kitchen"
    position: {x: 95, y: 50}
    tap_action:
      action: navigate
      navigation_path: /lovelace/kitchen
  - type: template
    content: "Living Room"
    position: {x: 50, y: 5}
    style:
      font_size: 16
      opacity: 0.6
```

Canvas elements can be configured in the visual editor's **Canvas Elements** section.

## 🔧 Custom CSS

### Global Custom CSS

Inject arbitrary CSS into the card's shadow DOM for full control over the card's appearance:

```yaml
custom_css: |
  .light-glow {
    mix-blend-mode: screen;
  }
  .canvas {
    border-radius: 16px;
  }
```

### Per-Entity Style Overrides

Apply inline CSS to individual entity containers:

```yaml
style_overrides:
  light.accent: "filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px gold);"
  light.ceiling: "opacity: 0.8; transform: scale(1.2);"
```

Both can be configured in the visual editor — global CSS in the **Custom CSS** section, and per-entity styles in each entity's expanded settings panel.

---

## 🎨 Visual Options

### Controls Below the Canvas (Default)
<!--```yaml
controls_below: true
always_show_controls: true
```-->
- Controls remain visible below the layout for quick access.
- Ideal when you never want controls to cover the floor plan.

### Floating Controls
<!--```yaml
controls_below: false
```-->
- Controls appear over the canvas when lights are selected.
- Minimal overlay that hides automatically when nothing is selected.

---

## 🎭 Theming

By default (`theme_mode: auto`) the card follows your dashboard's Home Assistant theme: card background, text and accent colors, dividers, and corner radius all come from the theme — including translucent "glass" themes, where the canvas stays transparent so the blurred card background shows through. Use `theme_mode: dark` to keep the card's original fixed dark look regardless of theme, or `theme_mode: light` for a fixed light palette.

Everything can be fine-tuned under `theme:` (also available in the visual editor's **Appearance** section):

```yaml
theme_mode: auto
theme:
  accent_color: "#22c1a3"        # selection rings, focus outlines, slider fill
  card_background: "#101418"     # ha-card + default canvas background
  canvas_background: "transparent"
  controls_background: "rgba(30,34,40,0.8)"
  slider_track: "#2a2e34"
  text_color: "#f5f7fa"
  secondary_text_color: "rgba(245,247,250,0.7)"
  border_color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.14)"
  grid_color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.05)"
  label_background: "rgba(20,22,26,0.75)"
  label_text: "#ffffff"
  border_radius: 20              # px
  glass: true                    # frosted, blurred control panels + header
  glass_blur: 18                 # px, default 16
```

All color values accept any CSS color. Every key is optional — leave one out to inherit it from the active theme. For a "Liquid Glass" look on a glass-themed dashboard, `theme_mode: auto` plus `theme: { glass: true }` is usually all you need.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Controls not showing?
- Select at least one light.
- Or enable Always Show Controls.
- Or configure the Default Entity to control something when nothing is selected.

### Lights not visible on load?
- Reload the dashboard after updating the card.

### Labels hard to read over the light?

They shouldn't be — light is always painted behind the names and icons, and
labels carry an opaque backing so nothing can bleed through them. If you have
deliberately set a translucent `theme.label_background`, that choice is
honoured as-is, so the light *will* show through it; remove it (or give it a
solid colour) to get the opaque backing back.

### Floor plan looks blurry or soft?

Almost always the source image is being **upscaled**. The card is as wide as its
dashboard column, and on a 2x display a full-width card renders a plan at
2000-3000 device pixels across — a 1000px-wide source has to be stretched to
fill that, and no CSS setting can invent the missing detail.

Open the browser console: the card measures your plan and tells you the exact
width you need, e.g.

```
[spatial-lights-card] Plan image is being upscaled 4.1x and will look soft:
source is 400x250, but this card renders it at 1640px wide
(820 CSS px x 2 device pixel ratio). Use a source at least 1640px wide...
```

What to do, in order of how much it helps:

1. **Use a bigger source.** Export the plan at the width the warning names, or
   wider. An SVG floor plan is better still — it is resolution-independent and
   stays sharp at any card width.
2. **Check what Home Assistant is actually serving.** A URL like
   `/api/image/serve/<id>/512x512` is a *downscaled variant* — HA generates
   several sizes on upload and that path pins you to a small one. Put the
   full-resolution file in `config/www/` and reference it as `/local/plan.png`
   instead.
3. **For line art, turn off smoothing:**
   ```yaml
   background_image:
     url: /local/plan.png
     rendering: crisp-edges   # or: pixelated
   ```
   This keeps edges hard rather than interpolated. It sharpens line drawings and
   hurts photographs, so it is not the default.
4. **Make the card narrower** (fewer grid columns), so less upscaling is needed.

JPEG artifacts are a separate matter — if the plan was saved as a low-quality
JPEG, re-export it as PNG or SVG.

## About the design
The design was somewhat inspired by the Philips Hue light controls, and thinking hard about how to improve over it. I liked about the Philips Hue app the ability to easily grab many lights and make them arbitrary colors, including multiple lights at the same time; and make many lights the same color. However, picking the specific light was still fairly difficult if you have a lot of lights.

This card solves all of the problems: identifying lights by their position in the physical space is much easier than identifying them by their position on the color wheel or finding them by name.

This allows very fast and easy setting of arbitrary groups of lights to specific color/temperature/brightness; there’s a mode that shows existing colors and presets to easily sync arbitrary lights to the same color.

Its current state is an enormous improvement over the default ways to have smart home dashboards, which usually have 1D lists with individual controls for each light (and each pre-defined light group) which either take space or need to be opened and are also hard to find if you have a lot of lights.

The card allows placing lights and other entities on a 2D canvas to easily control arbitrary lights/groups of lights (that's always a nightmare once you have dozens of devices).

Lights can be placed corresponding to their physical location and can be selected in arbitrary groups by dragging a selection box over them.

The card also supports switches (they can be toggled by a double or a single tap, depending on a setting) and binary sensors (it can display on/off states with arbitrary colors).

It also has color presets (for quickly setting lights to a specific color) and a live color mode (for quickly setting lights to a color that some lights in the card already have).

This card made turning dozens of lights to nice colors in arbitrary ways much easier.

## ToDo
- [ ] Think about adding arbitrary templates/HTML
- [x] Color effects (not just colors) among presets (with icons?)
- [ ] Add a setting for toggling lights with a single tap
- [ ] Toggling selected lights in a (double-?) tap (somewhere? on a button?)
- [ ] Think about a way to toggle groups of lights/the default entity?
- [ ] Possibly remove the global wall occlusion and do local walls for specific lights instead
- [ ] A mode to avoid accidental clicks on all lights? (e.g., requiring confirmation or long tap to open the wheel to set anything)
